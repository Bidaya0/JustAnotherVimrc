# JustAnotherVimrc

This repo started when I wanted to store my own vimrc file.
But we might as well start here, trying to package our development environment as an image.

Just like our operating environment for software in the cloud-native era.
or like these build-and-test-as-code projects, batect ,vagant,etc.

Perhaps this is a lightweight alternative to cloud IDEs.

So, take a try.

## Todo List

- Containerize existing development environment

- Optimize vimscript

- Add on-demand import plugins
